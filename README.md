# TypeScript-`p5.js` Boilerplate

This repository serves as a template for `p5.js` projects using TypeScript. All boilerplate required is present, so you can spend less time messing around with configuration and more time creative coding.

## Tooling

Both Prettier and ESLint are configured for this project. They currently don't have any custom configuration, so you are free to configure them as you wish.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bupedev/typescript-p5js-boilerplate.git <your_project_name
cd <your_project_name>
npm install
```

You can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will package your code and start a local server at `http://localhost:8080/`.
